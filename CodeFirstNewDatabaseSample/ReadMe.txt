In this walkthrough we looked at Code First development using a new database. 
We defined a model using classes then used that model to create a database and store and retrieve data. 
Once the database was created we used Code First Migrations to change the schema as our model evolved. 
We also saw how to configure a model using Data Annotations and the Fluent API.
